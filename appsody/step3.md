# Modify your application

Now let's try changing the code.

Using the embedded text editor, modify the file `app.js` in `my-project` directory to output something other than "Hello from Appsody!". Changes are being saved as you type. Appsody picks up the change and automatically updates the container.

Refresh https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-3000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/ to see the new message!

To stop the local development container, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> in the terminal.

You've now finished the development work for your Appsody project. You have a containerized application that's ready to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster.
